# DataAnnotations example

This is a fairly simple example of creating a custom ValidationAttribute, registering that attribute with MVC 3 to be compiled into the HTML5 data-val-* attributes, and parsing those attributes on the client side to be validated with a custom function using the jquery.validate.unobtrusive plugin.

This example is code associated with my blog post [here](http://www.ipreferjim.com/?p=606).
